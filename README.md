# 3D-SAT-collision-system
 
Worked on as part of an assignment, requiring us to work on top of a base engine and add modularity and features over multiple assignments. 
Final step was to create a system for the engine, serving a specific purpose with a module that anyone could include in their engine. 
This final engine was then used to create a basic game to showcase the systems built for the engine. 
My module was the Separating Axis Theorem based 3D collision detection. 

Main projects in solution created by me : 
- Components
- Collision
- Final Game
